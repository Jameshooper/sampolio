# Sampolio — Home Assistant Add-on

This add-on packages Sampolio, the self-hosted personal finance planner in
this repository, so it can be installed and run directly from Home
Assistant's Supervisor (Settings → Add-ons). It is a container image built
from the repo's own `Dockerfile`, running the same Next.js app documented in
the root [`README.md`](README.md) and [`docs/`](docs/) — not a different
build.

This is an **alternative deployment path**. It does not change or depend on
the maintainer's own launchd/Caddy production setup described in
[`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md); the two are independent
installs of the same app.

## Installing

1. In Home Assistant: **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories**,
   add this repository's URL.
2. Find **Sampolio** in the store and click **Install**. The first install
   builds the image locally (it is not published to a registry), which can
   take a few minutes.
3. Open the **Configuration** tab and fill in the required options (below)
   before starting.
4. Start the add-on, then use **Open Web UI** (or `http://<your-ha-host>:3999`).

## Configuration options

| Option | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_secret` | **Yes** | NextAuth session secret. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. |
| `encryption_key` | **Yes** | AES-256-GCM master key for the encrypted data files. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Never change this once data exists** — existing accounts become unreadable. |
| `auth_url` | **Yes** | The public URL you'll reach Sampolio at, e.g. `http://homeassistant.local:3999` or your own reverse-proxy URL. Used by NextAuth for redirects. |
| `enable_banking_app_id` | No | Enable Banking (PSD2 AIS) application id. Leave all three `enable_banking_*` options blank to keep bank sync fully disabled (zero network calls) — see [`docs/bank-sync.md`](docs/bank-sync.md). |
| `enable_banking_redirect_url` | No | Must be `<auth_url>/api/bank/callback` and publicly reachable if bank sync is enabled. |
| `enable_banking_private_key` | No | The RS256 PKCS#8 PEM contents (not a file path) for the Enable Banking application. Written to `/data/enable_banking_private_key.pem` inside the add-on's persistent storage at startup. |
| `ha_webhook_url` | No | A Home Assistant webhook URL (`.../api/webhook/<id>`) that Sampolio's own Split feature POSTs shared-expense activity to — see `docs/features.md` "Home Assistant notifications". This is unrelated to installing the add-on itself; it lets Sampolio *notify* Home Assistant. |

Options marked required are enforced at container startup: the add-on exits
immediately with a clear error if any are missing, rather than falling back
to an insecure default (matching the non-Docker deployment's behavior — see
`docs/operations.md` §8).

## Data & backups

All encrypted user data lives under `/data/sampolio` inside the add-on's
persistent storage volume, which Home Assistant keeps across add-on updates
and restarts. Include this add-on's data in your normal Home Assistant
**Settings → System → Backups** snapshots to back it up.

## Ports

The add-on listens on `3999/tcp` by default; remap it from the add-on's
**Network** tab like any other add-on. It is a direct port (not Ingress), so
opening the web UI takes you to Sampolio in a new browser tab rather than
embedding it in the Home Assistant frontend — Sampolio's security headers
deny being framed (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`), which
this add-on does not change.

## Updating

Update like any other add-on from the Supervisor UI. Your `/data` volume is
untouched by updates. `encryption_key` must never change across an update —
losing it (or changing it) makes existing data unreadable.
